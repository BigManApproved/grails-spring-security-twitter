Grails plugin for Twitter Authentication, as extension to Grails Spring Security Core plugin

h1. Information

Sources: [https://github.com/splix/grails-spring-security-twitter]

h2. Requirements:
 * grails 1.3.7
 * spring-security-core plugin 1.1+
 * twitter4j (will be downloaded automatically)

h2. How to install:
{code}
grails install-plugin spring-security-core
grails s2-quickstart
grails install-plugin spring-security-twitter
grails s2-init-twitter
{code}

h1. Usage:

Add CSS into your view layout:
{code}
<link rel="stylesheet" href="${resource(dir:'css',file:'twitter-auth.css')}" />
{code}

Put sign-in button:
{code}
<twitterAuth:button/>
{code}

after clicking this button user will be authenticated through twitter, and redirected to main page (configurable at spring-security-core)

Note that Twitter requires to use some domain name for your app (so 127.0.0.1 isn't working here), to achieve this you can add following line:
{code}
127.0.0.1 mytestdomain.local
{code}
into your /etc/hosts file (%SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc\ for Windows). Where mytestdomain.local is a domain name you would like to use for local testing.

h1. Configuration

After plugin install you'll get twitter keys stored in your grails-app/conf/Config.groovy, that can be modified later.

Default config:
{code}
security {
   twitter {

        language = "en_US"
        button.text = "Login with Twitter"
        popup = false

        autoCreate {
            active = true
            roles = ["ROLE_USER", "ROLE_TWITTER"]
        }

        filter {
            processUrl = "/j_spring_twitter_security_check"
            processPopupUrl = "/twitterAuth/popup"
        }

        domain {
            classname = "TwitterUser"
            connectionPropertyName = "user"
        }
    }
}
{code}
